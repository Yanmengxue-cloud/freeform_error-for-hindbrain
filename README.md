# freeform_error-for-hindbrain
I can register the sample_brain dataset in brainreg using the parameters from Figure 1. But when I extracted a portion of the hindbrain from the sample_brain to form the sample_hindbrain dataset and attempted to register it using the same parameters, an error occurred during the freeform stage.
